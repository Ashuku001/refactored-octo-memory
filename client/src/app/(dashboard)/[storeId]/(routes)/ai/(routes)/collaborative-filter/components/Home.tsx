            Collaborative-based recommendation filter is used to process and analyze customers&apos; information and recommend products a customer is likely to purchase. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaborative filtering algorithms use a customer&apos;s purchase history and ratings to find similar customers and then suggest items that the other customer liked. For example to find a new restaurant you can ask your friends for suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two types of collaborative filters. user-to-user and item-to-item filtering.
